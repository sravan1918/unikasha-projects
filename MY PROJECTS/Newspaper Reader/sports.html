                        <h5>The much-anticipated Carlsen-Gukesh match saw the Norwegian ace win in 36 moves.</h5>
                        <p>Indian Grandmaster Viswanathan Anand shot into the lead at the end of three rounds of the Rapid segment in the third leg of the 2023 Grand Chess Tour after registering two victories here on Thursday.

                            Five-time world champion Anand defeated GMs Richard Rapport and Constantin Lupulescu (both of Romania) on day one after starting with a draw against young Alireza Firouzja.

                    <h3>SAFF Championship: Indian football on the rise with a settled squad and a never-say-die attitude</h3>
                    <p> <b>The progressive style of play brought in by head coach Igor Stimac has worked well for the Blue Tigers</b>
                        <br>
                        Late on Tuesday night, after India’s SAFF Championship triumph here, Igor Stimac was brusque in terming the victory as a not-so-important milestone in India’s journey towards the AFC Asian Cup.

There is some merit in it, for the marquee continental competition is more than six months away and India, over the coming months, will test itself in two better-quality four-nation events – King’s Cup (Thailand) and Merdeka Tournament (Malaysia). It may also be Stimac’s way of not letting his players get ahead of themselves.

                <h3>‘It’s like a virus,’ says former cricketer Hussain on England team dropped catches</h3>
                <p><b>Drops by Jonny Bairstow and Joe Root proved costly as Mitchell Marsh went on to score 118 runs, which Hussain believes played a significant role in England being 2-0 down in the series</b>
                    <br>
                    England's former captain Nasser Hussain seemed disappointed with the missing chances by the English team on the field against Australia in the third test match of the Ashes series.

On the first day of the third test, England continued to let down with their on-field performance. Jonny Bairstow dropped catches behind the stumps of Steve Smith and Travis Head while Joe Root filed to catch Mitchell Marsh at 12 runs. Marsh then scored 118 runs in the match.

                            <h3>Kohli's problems outside off-stump continue, focus on Jaiswal's batting slot ahead of Test debut</h3>
                            <p><b>With Kohli taking his spot at No. 4 and Ajinkya Rahane at No. 5, along with Ravindra Jadeja at No. 6 and KS Bharath at No. 7, the batting order looks more or less sorted.</b>
                                <br>
                                Virat Kohli's struggles outside the off-stump continued as he was once again snapped behind the stumps during an intra-squad practice game while Yashasvi Jaiswal made strong claims for a coveted Test cap ahead of the series opener against the West Indies.

Jaiswal's Test debut is a matter of time but what could be a subject of discussion is his usual batting slot which is opening or one down, a position that the seasoned Cheteshwar Pujara was forced to vacate after nearly three years of non-performance and an archaic style of Test match batting.

                            Bangladesh one-day captain Tamim Iqbal announced his shock retirement from international cricket on Thursday, three months before the team begins its ODI World Cup campaign in India.

                             The 34-year-old was in tears as he announced his decision to end his 16-year international career in a news conference.

                        West Zone batters built on the good work done by their bowlers on the second day against Central Zone as the defending champion took control of the Duleep Trophy semifinal at the Alur (I) Cricket Ground in Bengaluru on Thursday.

Suryakumar Yadav and Cheteshwar Pujara scored half-centuries as a free-stroking West ended with a 241-run lead after it had bundled out Central for 128, with Arzan Nagwaswalla claiming a five-wicket haul.
