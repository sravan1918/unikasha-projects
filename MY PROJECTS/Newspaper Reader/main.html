                <h3>Adipurush' box office collection Day 3:</h3>
                <p> Prabhas' highly anticipated film, Adipurush, is enjoying a great run in theatres.

On Sunday, June 18, the film did great business in theatres and is said to have earned nearly Rs 64 crore in India.

            <h3>Why has the RBI withdrawn Rs 2,000 notes?</h3>
            <p> The RBI issued the majority of the Rs 2000 denomination notes prior to March 2017; these notes are now at the end of their estimated lifespan of 4-5 years. This denomination is no longer commonly used for transactions; besides, there is adequate stock of banknotes in other denominations to meet currency requirements.

                “In view of the above, and in pursuance of the ‘Clean Note Policy’ of the Reserve Bank of India, it has been decided to withdraw the Rs 2000 denomination banknotes from circulation,” the RBI said.

                        <h3>What is Google’s New AI, AudiopaLM?</h3>
                        <p>Google’s new AI-powered search experience, released in May, might have gotten a mixed reception. But the search giant isn’t letting that slow its feature roadmap.

                            Google today announced new capabilities, some of which it previously previewed at its I/O conference, heading to Search Generative Experience (SGE) — the moniker for its experimental search experience — focused on travel and shopping.
                            
                            Now, when a user asks questions about a place or destination in Google Search (e.g. “Is this restaurant good for large groups?”), they’ll see a snapshot that brings together information from across the web as well as reviews, photos and business profile details submitted by business owners. And when they’re shopping for a product — Bluetooth speakers, say — SGE will show factors to consider along with product descriptions, reviews, ratings, prices, images and recommendations.

                    <h3>India Leads Worldwide in Childhood Diabetes and Fatalities</h3>
                    <p> A recent study published in the journal JAMA Network revealed that India recorded the highest number of childhood diabetes cases and deaths in 2019, underlining the urgency of addressing this growing health concern. The research also highlighted important findings regarding disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and global trends in childhood diabetes. 
                        According to the study, India faced the highest number of childhood diabetes cases and deaths in 2019. This statistic emphasizes the pressing need to address the prevention, management, and treatment of diabetes among children in the country. By understanding the factors contributing to this burden, healthcare professionals and policymakers can devise targeted strategies to mitigate the associated morbidity and mortality

                <h3>Solar Radiation Management</h3>
                <p> The United States is considering a controversial tool called Solar Radiation Management (SRM) to address global warming. In a recent White House report, various activities were proposed to implement SRM, including injecting aerosols and brightening marine clouds to reflect sunlight into space. While the concept of SRM has gained interest, scientists have raised concerns about the environmental, social, and geopolitical risks associated with its deployment. To ensure responsible research and decision-making, a research governance framework for solar geoengineering research is expected to be established.
