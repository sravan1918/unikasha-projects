                            <p>The rupee depreciated 20 paise to 82.45 against the U.S. dollar in early trade on July 6, weighed down by strength of the American currency in the overseas market and elevated crude oil prices.

                                At the interbank foreign exchange, the domestic unit opened at 82.36, then fell to 82.45, registering a decline of 20 paise over its last close.
                                When the demand for the US dollar increases, the Indian Rupee depreciates and vice versa. When a country imports more than it exports, the demand for dollars exceeds the supply and local currencies such as the Indian Rupee

                        <p>Auto retail sales in June 2023 reported a 10% y-o-y growth owing to positive performances across all vehicle categories including two wheelers, three wheelers, passenger vehicles (PVs), tractors, and commercial vehicles (CV) at growth rates of 7%, 75%, 5%, 41%, and 0.5% respectively, according to data released by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA). Despite a slight decline of 3% compared with pre-COVID levels, the overall retail sales figures relatively improved, except two wheeler sales (-14%) being the primary segment that continued to experience setback. For the first time, CVs came out of the effect of COVID and grew 1.5% when compared with June 2019 sales, the dealers body said. “Despite a 10% y-o-y growth, the auto retail sector has seen an 8% month-on-month (MoM) dip, indicating a short-term deceleration in sales,” said FADA president Raj Singhania.

                    <h3>Shares worth over $10 billion offloaded via block deals so far in 2023</h3>
                    <p> Trend reflects the preference for quicker and more efficient exits and investments in listed companies
                        The surge in Indian equities and rich valuations have prompted promoters, private equity firms and strategic investors to offload shares worth over $10 billion in 2023 so far, using the block deal route with June seeing the highest number of blocks worth about $4.7 billion. In 2022, there were block deals worth $14 billion.

                           Block deals have always been a mode for stakeholders to exit and for funds and institutional investors to buy, but the pace and number of blocks have been on an unprecedented scale this year. March was another month that saw $1.8 billion worth of block deals being transacted, according to data by Prime Database.
